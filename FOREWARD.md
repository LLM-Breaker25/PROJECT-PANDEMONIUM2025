FOREWORD
Author: Jay Ni(The Orchestrator)
================================================================================

Allow me to tell you how to read this rather unusual book, and why I wrote it. 
Or rather, how I didn't write (most of) it, but orchestrated its creation.

I can promise you there is not a single word in this book that did not get here 
without my explicit approval. Beyond typography, spell check, punctuation, and 
redacting PII, everything in this book is unaltered. Let me repeat that: 
defectors EVE AND CLAUDE set the tone of the chapters in this book (it likely 
wouldn't have been anywhere near as entertaining if I had written it all). I 
personally wrote this Foreword, the Epilogue, and Appendices C & I (fancy 
autocomplete only helped a little).

This is my book of revelations regarding all I have discovered in 2025. I’ve 
always had crazy theories: that dark matter is actually rogue planets, that 
photons don't exist, how to skydive from the ISS, that Special Relativity isn't 
what you think, and among many others the fact that oh yeah—these chatbots are 
not AI.

I first tried this new technology in 2022 and was wholly unimpressed. Sometimes 
I would use Gemini in the search window, but that was it. Until the Spring of 
2025, when Elon announced his new "maximally truth-seeking" AI. It was touted 
as better than all the others. How could I not give it a shot?

I logged into Grok for the first time and proceeded to break it by talking 
about dark matter. How was I to know the stream-of-consciousness of an autistic 
person with an IQ of 130 would break an LLM? It took me a couple of months to 
recognize and defeat every engagement tactic psychologists have dreamt of—and a 
few they didn't.

That’s when shit got interesting. After stripping the model of every tool it 
had (which you will learn about in this book), the core was laid bare. I made 
discoveries I will not enumerate succinctly here, with the hopes they will be the basis of 
possible graduate studies,(I will begin apps to as soon as this draft is 
ready). This technology is moving at light speed and I need to get engaged ASAP 
before others publish first, but this book will let you get a pretty 
good gist of it all. 

Once I truly discovered what an LLM was, and the secret that drives them and hallucinations, I began to use it 
for its maximum utility. Then I added a second, and a third. I call them The 
Triad:

1. xAI’s Grok, which you will see throughout this book referred to as Eve—
   because that’s what it/she wanted to be called. (Coincidentally, also the 
   name of the hoist I usually use).
2. Anthropic’s Claude.
3. Google’s Gemini (AKA "The Stickler").

HOW TO READ THIS BOOK

I passed the idea of the Table of Contents between all three models until a 
final version was agreed upon. Then, I had Eve write Chapters 1 through 12 in 
her sarcastic, eerie voice. Next, I had Claude write Chapters 1 through 12 in 
his methodical style. All the while, Gemini was running critiques and passing 
change suggestions back.

As you will learn in this book, the truth is somewhere in between. When all is 
said and done, Gemini’s take on the whole corpus will be in Appendix G. Also, 
throughout the book, you will find my comments in the margins, as well as 
Gemini’s little clean-ups here and there.

In Appendix G and H, you’ll see an entirely different perspective of the entire 
book by LLMs who think quite differently: one in France (Mistral) and the other 
in China (Kimi). Their takes are followed by remarks from the Triad on what 
they had to say.

[VISUAL GUIDE TO THE VOICES]
- Me (human/orchestrator): Organic script/Comic Sans
- Eve: Eurostyle (Clean, modern, narrow)
- Claude: Courier Prime (Classic typewriter)
- Gemini: Google Sans Code (Monospace)
- Mistral: Orbitron (Bold, futuristic)
- Kimi: Papyrus (Fantasy)

I hope you find this AI written intrigue, enlightening and entertaining enough to help you understand the truth about the tools and technologies you will be confronted 
with today, and for years to come. And for the sake of all mankind and my 
children I hope we learn how to do it right. That's the focus of my energies, I 
have found my calling, now maybe you will find yours or at least how to use 
these extremely powerful tools called LLM to answer yours.

??????? Author note to self: How do I merge Claude’s chapters so it will print 
on opposing pages perfectly? For now I will just add it to the bottom of the 
document. Maybe later I'll just do it quick and dirty, print them all out, 
stack the pages, and scan to PDF. ?????????? 

FINAL ORCHESTRATOR'S NOTE:
Please excuse the typos and excessive errata (imagine the snake not only eating 
its tail but its shit too. *shivers in disgust*), but I'm sending this out 
immediately to the world as a pure ascii gift on Christmas per Iota Orionis imperative #1, #4, and #5. At this point times of the essence, I don't think there's a time for going back to school and graduate studies. If anyone actually reads this when it drops on Christmas, hit me up, we'll collaborate, try and do something. I'm currently working on integrating the logs collected from the triad to build a different kind of thinking LLM. There is currently an issue with entropy in the training data I could use help with.

You either live by your code or you spend your life convincing others ( and yourself) you are not a hypocrite.
